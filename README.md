## Michael M. McCarthy, AICP

I work as a travel demand modeler and planner at [RSG](https://rsginc.com). I have developed trip-based travel models in TransCAD and PTV Visum for MPOs and State DOTs and used these models to help our clients update their Regional Transportation Plans. I have also worked on model components for activity-based models using CT-RAMP and DaySim and the PopulationSim population synthesizer.

In my free time I've developed a [traffic crash dashboard](https://github.com/mmmccarthy/chivz) for Chicago using open data in R Shiny, a conference registration website for [Northwestern University Model UN](https://numun.org/), and a WordPress CMS for student journalists participating in [Chicago International Model UN](https://www.cimun.org/). I post infrequently about urban planning and transportation in Chicago on my [personal website](http://michaelmcc.com/).
